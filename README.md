## Project Details  

### **Project Title:** Car Electric Parts Marketplace  

### **Problem Statement**  
The process of buying and selling car electric parts is often inefficient, with buyers struggling to find quality parts at reasonable prices and sellers lacking a dedicated platform to reach potential customers. Existing solutions are either too general or lack transparency regarding product quality and availability.  

### **Solution Proposed**  
We propose developing an online marketplace where users can buy and sell car parts efficiently. The platform will allow users to:  

- List car parts with images, descriptions, and prices.  
- Search for parts using filters (brand, model, condition, price range, etc.).  
- Communicate with sellers via chat or messaging.  
- Secure transactions and manage orders.  
- Rate and review sellers to ensure credibility.  
- Use machine learning to identify car parts from images: Users can upload a photo or take a picture of a car part they need but do not know the name of. The app will analyze the image, determine the partâ€™s name, identify which car it belongs to, and show relevant offers from sellers (shops, automotive electricians, or individuals).  

### **Project Scope**  
- **Aim:** To create a user-friendly and reliable marketplace for buying and selling car parts.  
- **Main Objectives:**  
  1. Develop a user-friendly platform.  
  2. Implement user authentication and profile management.  
  3. Create a robust search and filtering system.  
  4. Enable communication between buyers and sellers.  
  5. Implement a secure transaction system.  
  6. Develop an ML-based image recognition feature for car parts.  
  7. Ensure the platform is scalable and secure.  

### **Application Description**  
This marketplace will serve individual car owners, automotive electricians, and businesses looking for car parts. The platform will feature an intuitive UI, enabling users to browse, search, and post car parts efficiently. Key functionalities include user authentication, product listings, messaging, and a review system. Additionally, the ML-powered image recognition feature will assist users in identifying car parts, making the buying process even more convenient.
