# Project Details

## Project Title: [Your Project Title]

## Problem Statement:
The healthcare system often lacks user-friendly digital solutions for medical analysis, making it challenging for patients to track their health status and for doctors to manage patient information efficiently. The current process is time-consuming, paper-based, and can lead to delays or mistakes in medical treatment.

## Solution Proposed:
We propose the development of a web application that allows patients to easily book appointments, access their medical analysis results, and track their health metrics. For doctors, the system will provide tools to manage patient information, appointments, and medical results efficiently.

## Project Scope:
- **Aim:** The aim of this project is to streamline the process of medical analysis management in clinics, providing a better user experience for both patients and healthcare providers.
- **Main Objectives:**
  1. Develop a user-friendly interface for patients to book appointments and view medical results.
  2. Build a dashboard for doctors to manage patient data, appointments, and analysis results.
  3. Integrate with external lab services to allow patients to view their medical results online.
  4. Implement secure authentication for both patients and doctors.

## Application Description:
The Clinic Medical Analysis Application will serve as a platform for both patients and doctors. Patients will be able to:
- Register and manage their profiles.
- Schedule appointments with doctors.
- View and download their medical analysis results.
- Track their health metrics, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

Doctors will be able to:
- Manage patient profiles and appointments.
- View and interpret medical analysis results.
- Track patient health data and provide recommendations.
